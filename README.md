# debugging
"WebSocket connection to 'wss://localhost:3000/' failed"
- because the local dev server is using a self-signed ssl certificate and not domain specific CA certificate; browsers by default don't trust it. to get around this issue, visit https://localhost:3000 You will be presented with a screen saying connection is not private. For the purposes of testing you can click on Advanced and then proceed anyway. When you refresh the website at http://localhost the websocket should now connect.

"driver not found"
- after initially booting up your server you may see a driver not found message on the screen. this should go away after a few seconds as mysql service is still booting up.
